WEBVTT

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:43.084
Did you hear? He got into a fight again.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.335
What? Really?

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.087
Talk about annoying.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:52.051
Again? This is why I was
against taking him in.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.762
Better not get involved with him.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.305
Yeah. Like, look at him.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.059
We had no choice, okay?
Nobody else was willing to take him.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.811
Given that boy's creepy look,
that's a given.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.815
Hey, I told you to dye your hair black!
Why won't you ever listen?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.067
You have no wallet?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.109
That's the guy?

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.569
He's the worst.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.863
Besides, what's up with that hair?

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:13.573
Nah, his eyes are worse.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.575
He brings nothing but misfortune.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.952
Disgusting.

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:45.897
TONPU MARKET STREET

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.149
Wait for me!

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.622
I only like the strong.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.834
I have no interest in the weak.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.964
Listen, I said get out of my way.

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.550
Come on, don't be like that.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.554
Don't you wanna hang out?
Isn't there anything you wanna do?

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.515
I'd really love...

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.935
to smash these eggs into your face.

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:26.855
But my hands are full,
and it'd be a waste,

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.857
so I won't!

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.319
I like a woman who knows how to bark.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.739
But if you go too far, you might get hurt.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.908
Hey! That hurts!

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:43.163
Weaklings who act all smug,
thinking they're strong...

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.789
Let me go!

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.333
Huh?

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.378
Don't be so lame in the middle of the day.

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.755
Huh? What's your problem?

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.716
And what's up with that fancy look?

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.175
Get lost!

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:02.056
...make me sick!

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:12.942
You've got to have a few screws loose
to even think you're strong.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.781
Be sure you remember my name and my face.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.659
So that the weak avoid me,

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.704
and the strong seek me out.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.789
I am...

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.836
Haruka Sakura from Furin High School!

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.063
Wait!

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.400
Hey! I said wait!

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.569
Thank you.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.077
Huh? Me?

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.289
Who else here would I say that to?

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.962
I didn't do it to save you or anything!

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.798
I just can't stand those people!

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.260
Anyway, are you hungry?

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.804
Huh? No, I'm not!

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:52.560
Oh? So you're from out of town?

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.605
No wonder I've never seen you.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.816
We don't often see new faces in this town.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.069
Yeah, I'm just another weirdo.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:05.198
No, that's not what I mean.
It's not about your look.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:08.618
This town was very unsafe
with a lot of teams and gangs

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.913
and whatnot
breaking into fights not too long ago.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:14.791
So normal people wouldn't
even try to come close.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.544
That said, I also came from out of town.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:23.049
I'm Kotoha Tachibana. Nice to meet you.

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:27.386
Why is she so friendly?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.263
Most people would be freaked out.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.433
I just pummeled five guys in front of her!

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.018
Also...

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.937
Hm? You're not gonna eat?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.147
You don't like omelet rice?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.067
I'm eating! I'm gonna dig in now!

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.403
It's good!

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.076
Can I get a takeoff here?

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.162
Huh? You mean takeout?
We don't do that here.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.873
Oh, I see. You don't do that, huh?

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:59.168
Still, you sure have a strange look.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.337
Your hair and eyes split in color.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.048
You don't dye your hair
or wear contact lenses, right?

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.425
Huh? You got a problem wi...

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.553
Wow, it's like a marble.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.471
I've never seen this color before.

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:14.100
What? You wanna go, huh?

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:16.269
I'm not staring you down for a fight, man.

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:18.604
You're a weird one.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:22.525
Most people get freaked out,
or try to push me away.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.653
Well, I'm used to seeing crazier people.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:26.696
Like this.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.030
Like what, exactly?

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.116
Is that why?

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.455
How you look doesn't matter in a fight.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.208
That's why I came to Furin.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.543
{\an8}FURIN

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:45.131
The school with the lowest average
scores and the strongest brawlers.

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:46.757
The place where failures gather.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.636
Factions are always fighting,
and the underlings unseating their bosses.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.098
Be it Obon or New Year's,
there isn't a day they aren't fighting.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.685
That's where I'll climb to the top!

00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:59.896
Oh, that's some pretty big talk.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.314
Not really.

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.609
The lowest of the low, hated by all,
worth nothing but their fists,

00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:08.112
fighting to become the strongest one
around. Sounds great to me.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:12.116
It's a battle to determine
the scummiest of the scum.

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.744
That suits me perfectly.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.206
You sure have high expectations.

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:24.504
Oh, so that's why you're wearing uniform
even though school starts tomorrow?

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.214
You're excited, aren't you?

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.424
No, I am not!

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.719
This is, um, that! I just moved in
and have no other clothes!

00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:35.806
Oh, really? You're pumped for
your new school life, aren't you?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.934
You little... Let's take this outside!

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.478
Thanks for the meal, Kotoha-chan.

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:43.981
I left the money on the table.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:47.693
Okay! Thanks for coming
as always, Yama-jii!

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.237
Take care.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.239
Yeah, I'll come again.

00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:53.699
Hey, old man.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.452
You forgot your bag.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.207
Oh, goodness.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.669
I've been forgetting things a lot lately.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.097
She's making no sense.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.099
Here.

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:21.978
He said that was a present
for his grandkid.

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:25.273
"You really helped me.
Thank you," he said.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.733
Why are you blushing?

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.319
Huh? Shut up!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.240
Besides, this whole town's weird!
Including you!

00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:35.157
Huh?

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.285
You know how weird I look.

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:41.455
Plus, I'm wearing the uniform of
this area's infamous delinquent school!

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:45.501
How can he... thank someone like me?

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.379
Normally people would have
their guard up or suspect me.

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:52.383
Last time I picked up someone's wallet,
they thought I stole it.

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:53.301
POLICEEEE!

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:56.679
He's gotta be more cautious and
check if everything's still inside!

00:09:56.762 --> 00:10:00.516
Do you want people to trust you or not?
Make up your mind.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:06.355
Sakura, it was right for you
to choose Furin.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:11.861
But you will never be the top of Furin.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.405
No matter what.

00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:15.865
Huh?

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:18.784
In your current state,
forget about the top,

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.370
no one in Furin would even
give you the time of day.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.830
As if!

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:25.499
You don't even know just how strong I am!

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.878
Yeah, you might have some skills,

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.632
but that's not enough
to be the top of Furin.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:34.717
Because...

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:37.928
you are alone.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:48.481
I'm not so weak that I can't win
without relying on other people!

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:55.196
I'm not talking about
being physically alone.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.908
You should go meet the Furin kids first.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.120
Once you do,
you will understand what I mean.

00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.430
{\an8}AMAKURA LIQUOR STORE

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.225
Yes, hello?

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.187
Oh, there you are.

00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:32.900
I didn't expect you'd show up on your own.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.362
you Furin punk.

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:57.675
Whoa, there. Ignoring me now?

00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:01.470
You're the one who told me not
to forget your name and face,

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.597
but you forgot it yourself?

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:06.934
Well, it's not like I can forget
your lame-ass face.

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:10.646
Dyeing your hair and wearing contacts?
Is that supposed to be a cosplay?

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:12.440
Hm? Wait.

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:16.444
That's your real hair?
And you're not wearing any contacts.

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:18.404
Really? That's his real hair?

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:19.822
What is he, a cat?

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.824
Meow! Meow!

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.617
Disgusting.

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.913
This is more like it.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.249
This is the normal reaction.

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:33.627
Everyone is always avoiding
and rejecting me...

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.088
I don't care anymore.
I've given up already.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.840
But at the very least...

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:40.676
I want to find some worth in myself...

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:43.804
I thought if I beat the guy
in front of me,

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.098
that would make me feel better than him.

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.768
But you will never be the top of Furin.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.229
Because you are alone.

00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:57.860
You picked the wrong guy to fight.

00:12:57.943 --> 00:13:01.197
There ain't a team that'll stay quiet
after their head got hit.

00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:04.950
This now a war between us and Furin...

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:08.954
You people were the ones
who didn't want to be near me!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:14.210
I got a weird and strange look?
I know that better than anyone else!

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:17.796
But what have I ever done
to you guys with that?

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:20.966
This is...

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.927
This is who I am!

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.929
What the hell are you doing, you punk...

00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:27.848
If I'm good at fights...
If I'm the strongest one around...

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:31.936
That means I'm the top, right?
What does it matter if I'm alone?

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:35.606
You...

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.928
You little...

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:20.192
What are you doing?

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.778
Hey, brat! you better stand still!

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:27.616
You Furin bastards can't do a thing
if we take the townsfolk hostage!

00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:33.873
Thanks!

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.374
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.918
I just hate that guy.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.796
He brought a knife to a fistfight.

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.716
You bastards better be
careful about how you fight.

00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:52.558
I can read you like a book.

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:06.196
Dammit!

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.199
This ain't ever gonna end
if I gotta keep protecting her.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.202
Besides, why on earth
am I even protecting her?

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:16.999
Nothing good ever comes from
doing something for other people!

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.595
Ouch!

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.306
See?

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.684
This is why I shouldn't be
worrying about other people.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:37.895
Sakura!

00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:42.566
Just what the heck... am I even doing?

00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:44.902
What am I trying to do?

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:50.157
Are you a first-year?
Thanks for being here.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:54.328
A Furin uniform?

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.875
Kotoha-chan.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:05.381
Don't tell him that you
were caught up in trouble, okay?

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.390
Hey, you bastards.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:25.109
To swing this kind of thing in this town
is a serious matter...

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:29.905
and you better know what it means!

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:35.577
Oh, come on! There are way
fewer people than what she said!

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:38.247
We could've handled this with two people.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.999
Why...

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:43.335
are Furin students helping me?

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:44.420
It's Furin!

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.963
It's Furin's Hiragi!

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:49.216
Don't be chicken!
There are only four more people!

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:50.551
Go!

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:55.097
Matsumoto, Kaji, Yanagida!

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.891
If you let a single one
of them get past us,

00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:59.351
I'll kick your ass!

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.521
There you go!

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:13.365
Come on! Bring it!

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.079
Crap!

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.459
If you're hurt, then stand back!

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:27.421
Don't order me around! That guy was mine!

00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:29.339
Just stay still, you moron!

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.383
If you keep wobbling around...

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.218
we won't be able to protect you!

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.525
Go! Get them!

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:53.197
What? What's going on?

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:58.368
I told you that this town was
very unsafe with a lot of teams,

00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:02.498
gangs and whatnot breaking
into fights not too long ago, didn't I?

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.084
To be precise, it was until two years ago.

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.628
Since then, the town has changed.

00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:11.590
The people who changed it
were the students of Furin High.

00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:15.803
The first thing they did was
set up a sign in front of town.

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:21.391
If you don't know how to use a bat,
at least learn how to read!

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:25.646
"Anyone past this point,
who causes pain...

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:27.856
who brings destruction,

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.608
who holds evil in their heart..."

00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:34.738
They originally had Furin High's
name written next to it...

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:38.909
Eventually,
the townsfolk gave them a new name.

00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:43.372
To the students who fight
to protect the town...

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:48.502
"...will be purged by Bofurin
without exception!"

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.838
{\an8}Bofurin.

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.548
{\an8}The shield of this town.

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:55.676
The Wind Breaker.

00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:01.473
-Thank you, guys!
-Thanks a lot!

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.892
You boys are life savers!
Thank you always.

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:07.855
The lowest of the low, hated by all.

00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:10.732
That was the case two years ago.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.819
They're still fighting, yes.

00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:17.739
-Granny! Didn't you say 100 people?
-But they're now loved and

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:21.201
-needed by everyone in town.
-My eyesight has gotten so bad lately.

00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:23.579
What the heck is that?

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:27.749
That sounds like a hero of justice.

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:33.297
-You were cool when you bent that bat!
-They're delinquents and fight...

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.384
-Anyone could pull that off.
-...but no one is afraid or avoiding them...

00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:39.386
They've been accepted here.

00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:40.637
Huh?

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.225
You were amazing too out there!

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.978
You did well fending them off
on your own at first!

00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.064
Boy, they hurt your leg, didn't they?

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:53.483
We need to treat it right away.

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:59.323
Stop it!

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:08.707
Sakura.

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:13.128
I said you were alone.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.296
But...

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:19.468
I could tell that you didn't become one
because you wanted to.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:24.181
But the people of this town need you.

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:25.307
TONPU MARKET STREET

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:27.476
Don't act like you know anything!

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:30.520
I don't need anyone and
I won't associate myself with anyone...

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:31.855
Then why...

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:35.359
did you give Yama-jii
the present he forgot?

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:39.071
Why did you save me?

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:42.699
You haven't given up on other people.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.660
You don't have to.

00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:49.206
At the very least, I'm facing you head-on.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:53.210
So you should lift
your face up to us, too.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.463
Once you do, I'm sure...

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:04.012
you will become the person you want to be.

00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:18.318
Delinquents trying to play the hero?

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:21.947
If all you gotta do is win in a fight,
then even I can do that!

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.826
What is all this Bofurin crap?
What is this "shield of the town" crap?

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:30.330
That's so damn cool!

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:40.966
Can I be with someone in this place?

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:52.185
This is the story of a boy
who's good for nothing but his fist,

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:54.730
the lowest of the low, and hated by all,

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.524
became the hero of the town.

00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:35.956
{\an8}I came to this town,
to Furin High, to fight.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.334
{\an8}However, that school,
now known as Bofurin,

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:41.795
{\an8}turned out to be a school
that protects the town.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.634
"Anyone who causes pain,
who brings destruction,

00:23:47.717 --> 00:23:54.182
who holds evil in their heart, will be
purged by Bofurin without exception," huh.

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:58.895
{\an8}Furin High looks like
it'll be quite a fun place.
